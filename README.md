## Windows 10 Deployment

The Microsoft Deployment Toolkit is probably the most beloved Operating System Deployment platorm by those who understand it and often scoffed at by those who do not.  There are several reasons for praise:  it's flexibility and large-scale efficiency are second to none.  Oh, and by the way, it's FREE!  But it is not without its flaws.  To the unintiated, MDT is finiky, unreliable, and requires significant time and effort to re-learn OSD.
